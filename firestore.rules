     * PROJECT FORGE SECURITY RULES
     *
     * Core Philosophy:
     * This ruleset implements a Public-Read/Admin-Write model. The application functions as a curated 
     * catalog of hardware projects. All project data, hardware specifications, and component 
     * information are globally accessible to facilitate discovery and learning.
     *
     * Data Structure:
     * The database uses a flat, top-level collection architecture (/project_categories, /hardware, 
     * /components, /projects). Relationships are maintained through denormalized foreign keys 
     * (e.g., primaryHardwareId inside a project document) to ensure high-performance querying 
     * and simple, independent security rules.
     *
     * Key Security Decisions:
     * 1. Administrative RBAC: Authorization for write operations is managed through a dedicated 
     *    top-level collection `/roles_admin/{userId}`. The presence of a document for a user's 
     *    UID in this collection grants administrative privileges.
     * 2. Public Read Access: All core content is readable by any user, including anonymous 
     *    and unauthenticated users, to maximize the app's utility as a public resource.
     * 3. Relational Integrity: On creation of any document, the rules enforce that the 
     *    document's internal 'id' field matches the Firestore Document ID to ensure consistency 
     *    between paths and data.
     *
     * Prototyping Mode:
     * These rules prioritize strict authorization (who can write) while remaining flexible 
     * regarding the internal schema of documents to allow for rapid iterative development.
